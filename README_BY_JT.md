In project folder,
git init - Initialize git repo
Make sure there's a .gitignore that at least ignores .DS_Store files. The default in x_template ignores all files starting with . except for .gitignore and is a good starting point.
Write a README.md file for the board based on the template.
git add . - Add all the files not ignored in this folder
git commit -m "<message>" - Make an initial commit
git remote add origin <url> - Set the url of origin to the repo's url. Use SSH version and set up an ssh key if you haven't already.
git push -u origin master - Push to the master branch
Nothing's been written for this board yet.
git clone <url> <name> - Clone the repo, naming the destination folder <name>
Use the template in x_template to initialize the repo and update the README.md.
git add . - Add all the files not ignored in this folder
git commit -m "<message>" - Make an initial commit
git push - Push.
